The {modelit} package adds the statistical models to the SciViews::R dialect. It uses both the `fun$type(data = ...., formula)` approach and the enhanced formula allowing to specify arguments with `%arg=%` directly inside the formula. It also takes the variable labels into account in the outputs.

The {modelit} package provides methods (**lm**, **glm**; **nls** objects) for the `chart()` function in the {chart} package and the `tabularise()` function in the {tabularise} package.

## Installation

{modelit} is not available from CRAN yet. You should install it from the [SciViews R-Universe](https://sciviews.r-universe.dev). {chart} is an alternate formula interface to {ggplot2}. {tabularise} produces publication-ready (rich-formatted) tabular output. The {equatags} and {equatiomatic} packages are optional, but they are useful to display equations, both inline in R Markdown/Quarto documents and in {tabularise} tables. {data.io} is useful too because it manages labels and units that {chart} uses. To install these six packages and their dependencies, run the following command in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('modelit', 'chart', 'tabularise', 'equatags', 'equatiomatic', 'data.io'),
  repos = c('https://sciviews.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

You can also install the latest development version of {modelit}. Make sure you have the {remotes} R package installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SciViews/modelit")
```

## Short example

```{r}
library(modelit)
library(tabularise)
library(chart)
```

The trees datasets present diameter, height and volume for Black Cherry Trees (*Prunus serotina*, Ehrh., 1788)

```{r}
data('trees', package = 'datasets')
```

We perform a polynomial regression of the volume of timber as a function of the girth of the trees.

```{r}
trees_lm <- lm(Volume ~ Girth + I(Girth^2), data = trees)
summary(trees_lm)
```


<!-- This produces an error !
Here is the summary of the model, using `tabularise()`:

``{r}
summary(trees_lm) |> tabularise()
``

-->

The model can be viewed using `chart()`:

```{r}
chart(trees_lm)
```

Residual analysis plots can also be carried out with `chart()`.

```{r}
chart$residuals(trees_lm)
```
