# modelit To Do list

-   ðŸ”¥ High Priority: Refactor all tabularise_***() methods for anova, aov, glm objects to improve internal consistency and prepare for multi-format table rendering using {flextable}, {tinytable}, and {gt}.

-   ðŸ”¥ High Priority: Improve translation management across the package. Currently, multiple calls to gettext() and gettextf() from {svMisc} are used.

-    Introduced the first version of tabularise_***() methods for objects such as lm, nls, and glm, initially designed to generate tables using the {flextable} package.
Future versions will support multiple output formats via {flextable}, {tinytable}, and {gt}.
To enable this flexibility, a unified internal object structure is being developed to store all relevant metadata (e.g., labels, units, formatting).
This structure will allow seamless conversion to different table formats using functions like as_flextable(), as_tinytable(), and as_gt().

-   Implement tabularise_***() methods for enriched model objects: nls_, lm_, summary.lm_, anova_, etc. These methods should leverage the metadata (e.g., labels, units) embedded in the enriched objects to produce consistent and informative tables.

-  Complete the examples sections of the tabularise_***() functions for the following object types: lm, summary.lm, nls, summary.nls,...

-   Implement tabularise_***() methods for merMod and summary.merMod objects (e.g., from lme4::glmer()).

-   Extend tabularise() support for anova and aov objects.
    - Rework the current implementation and determine the appropriate package context ({inferit}, {modelit}, or another).
    - Also consider integration with car::Anova().
    - Note: there is currently no proper tabularise_default() method for aov objects.

- Develop chart() method for lm objects with categorical predictors (e.g., visualizing factor effects).

- Add support for multiple comparisons.
